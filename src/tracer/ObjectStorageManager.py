"""
ObjectStorageManager - Handles uploading trace files to cloud storage.

This module provides the ObjectStorageManager class which manages:
- Connection testing to the backend storage service
- Getting presigned URLs for file uploads
- Uploading individual files
- Background upload workers with retry logic

The manager supports both manual and automatic upload modes,
with automatic upload using a background thread and queue system.

Example:
    manager = ObjectStorageManager(version="vRelease")
    manager.test_connection()  # Check if server is reachable
    manager.put_object("/path/to/trace.tar.zst")  # Upload a file
